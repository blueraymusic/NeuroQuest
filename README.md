# NeuroQuest

## Overview
**NeuroQuest** is an AI-powered RPG experience that dynamically generates quests, hints, and interactions based on player progress. Designed to merge storytelling with generative AI, the game creates an immersive and ever-evolving adventure.

## Inspiration
Inspired by classic RPGs and the potential of AI-driven narratives, we set out to build a game where no two playthroughs are the same. We wanted to push the boundaries of AI-assisted gameplay.

## Features
- **Dynamic Quest Generation**: AI crafts personalized quests based on player actions.
- **Smart Hints**: Get helpful hints without breaking immersion.
- **Seamless Integration**: Uses generative AI to enhance traditional RPG mechanics.

## How We Built It
We developed **NeuroQuest** using:
- **Python & Pygame**: For core game mechanics and rendering.
- **Gemini AI**: To generate quests and interact with the player.
- **Google Generative AI API**: To process player inputs and dynamically respond.
- **Game Assets**: Custom-designed sprites, maps, and UI components.

## Challenges We Faced
- **Balancing AI responses**: Ensuring the AI-generated hints and quests felt natural and engaging.
- **Performance Optimization**: Keeping real-time AI interactions smooth and lag-free.
- **Map Integration**: Ensuring AI correctly references in-game locations.

## Accomplishments
- Successfully created an AI-powered RPG experience.
- Implemented real-time AI interactions with minimal lag.
- Designed a compelling gameplay loop that keeps players engaged.

## Whatâ€™s Next
- Expanding quest diversity and depth.
- Enhancing AI dialogue for more nuanced interactions.
- Multiplayer integration for collaborative questing.
